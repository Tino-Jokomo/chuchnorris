# chucknorrisv1

Hi Thank you for coming across this Repo. So Essentially this code allows one to run the client side of a ChuckNorris Single Page App I developed for a SovTech test.
To get the full app running correctly (As it wont work properly without the server running - which will be seen by an error popping up(or nothing happening) after a category is clicked)
either 

A) :- Fork this project in CodeSandbox and follow the ReadMe in that project (in CodeSandbox) as it will have similar detailed steps to get the server running to ensure the whole project will run smoothly.

B) :- Email me to turn on the server (I will try leave it on anyway so that at any moment, testing this client should yield the desired result. Email me @- tjokomo@gmail.com . Please find the link to the client side here : https://tino-jokomo.github.io/chucknorrisv1/ . Once the server is turned on and running the app will be fully functional.

C) :-  Fork the master branch of the project here on github and when running it in your local machine cd into src -> cd src . And run the server.js file -> node server.js before running the main React App with -> npm start .

Thats it ! :) I hope you enjoy this little project i have developed . It's been an interesting couple of days learning GraphQL, Apollo Client and Apollo Server. I hope to improve on this for the future !
