# chucknorrisv1

Hi Thank you for coming across this Repo. So Essentially this code allows runs the client side of a ChuckNorris Single Page App developed for SovTech.
To get the full app running correctly (As it wont work properly without the server running - which will be seen by an error popping up(or nothing happening) after a category is clicked)
either 

A :- Fork this project in CodeSandbox and follow the ReadMe in that project as it will have similar detailed steps to get the server running to ensure the whole project will run smoothly.

B :- Email me to turn on the server (I will try leave it on anyway so that at any moment testing this client should yield desired result. Email me @- tjokomo@gmail.com

C :-  Fork this project and when running it in your local machine cd into src -> cd src . And run the server.js file -> node server.js

Thats it ! :) I hope you enjoy this little project i have developed . It's been an interesting couple of days learning GraphQL and Apollo Client and Apollo Server. I hope to improve on this for the future !
